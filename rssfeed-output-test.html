Original release date: December 5, 2022<br/><p>CISA has added one new vulnerability to its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog</a>, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities</a> established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the <a href="https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf">BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet</a> for more information.   </p>

<p>Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Catalog vulnerabilities</a> as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities">specified criteria</a>. </p>

Original release date: December 1, 2022<br/><p>Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and CISA released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-335a">#StopRansomware: Cuba Ransomware</a>&nbsp;to provide network defenders tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with Cuba ransomware. FBI investigations identified these TTPs and IOCs as recently as August 2022. This CSA updates the December 2021 <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211203-2.pdf">FBI Flash: Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba Ransomware</a>. Key updates include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>FBI has identified a sharp increase in the both the number of compromised U.S. entities and the ransom amounts demanded by Cuba ransomware actors.</li>
	<li>Since spring 2022, Cuba ransomware actors have expanded their TTPs.</li>
	<li>Third-party and open-source reports have identified a possible link between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors.</li>
</ul>

<p>FBI and CISA encourage network defenders to review the joint CSA and to apply the included mitigations. See <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware">StopRansomware.gov</a> for additional guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.</p>

Original release date: November 17, 2022 | Last revised: November 18, 2022<br/><p>Today, CISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), published the third of a three-part series on securing the software supply chain: <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/17/2003116445/-1/-1/0/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_CUSTOMER.PDF">Securing Software Supply Chain Series - Recommended Practices Guide for Customers</a>. This publication follows the August 2022 release of <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/01/2003068942/-1/-1/0/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DEVELOPERS.PDF">guidance for developers</a> and October 2022 release of <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/31/2003105368/-1/-1/0/SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_SUPPLIERS.PDF">guidance for suppliers</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance released today, along with the accompanying <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/17/2003116444/-1/-1/1/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_CUSTOMER_SLICKSHEET.PDF">fact sheet</a>, provides recommended practices for software customers to ensure the integrity and security of software during the procuring and deployment phases.</p>

<p>The Securing Software Supply Chain Series is an output of the Enduring Security Framework (ESF), a public-private cross-sector working group led by NSA and CISA. This series complements other U.S. government efforts underway to help the software ecosystem secure the supply chain, such as the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom">software bill of materials (SBOM) community</a>.</p>

<p>CISA encourages all organizations that participate in the software supply chain to review the guidance. See CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain">Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/ict-supply-chain-library">ICT Supply Chain Resource Library</a>, and <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/nrmc-resources">National Risk Management Center (NRMC)</a> webpages for additional guidance.</p>
